# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October, 7th, 2020:


**Today's Progress**: I made a simple calculator which is based on terminal! wanted to start things slow and easy. i kept the hart stuff for later!

**Thoughts:** fortunately it was as easy as drinking water! i'm really happy with how i have progressed in these few years
