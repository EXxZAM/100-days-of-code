# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October, 7th, 2020:


**Today's Progress**: I made a simple calculator which is based on terminal! wanted to start things slow and easy. i kept the hard stuff for later!

**Thoughts:** fortunately it was as easy as drinking water! i'm really happy with how i have progressed in these few years

**Today's Progress**: Today i made a GUI App that calculates the BMI of your body! It was written in Python using Tkinter library!

**Thoughts:** i'm so happy i made it without any problems! it took me 30 minutes so i'm going to start a new project for the other 30 minutes!
